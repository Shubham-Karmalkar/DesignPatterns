# DesignPatterns

While learning Design Patterns below are the most important questions to keep in mind:

1. What classes does it consist of?

2. What roles do these classes play?

3. In what way the elements of the pattern are related?


Development can be broken down into many parts some of which are like, core modules and client code.
1. Core modules: this are unit entity/class which represent specific set of object doing some specific things.
2. Clinet code: this is a code on server side only but the code which uses such many core modules/class is called client code.

NOTE: SOLID principles and Design patterns that we use are mostly releated to Core module and makes sure
    that we reduce complexity, increse reusability and not to break SOLID for these modules.
